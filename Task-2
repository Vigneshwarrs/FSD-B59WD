1) Difference between document and window:


Document Object
i) It represents any HTML document or web page that is loaded in the browser.
ii) It is loaded inside the window.
iii) All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
iv) We can access the document from a window using the window. document.
v) The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model).
vi) syntax: document.propertyname;
vii) example: document.title :  will return the title of the document

Window Object:
i) It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage.
ii) It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.
iii) Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.
iv) We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window.
v) The window is part of BOM (Browser Object Model), not DOM.
vi) syntax: window.propertyname;
vii) example: window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser
